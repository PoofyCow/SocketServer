SocketServer
============

This is an all included socket server.
If you are looking for the easiest way to setup a tcp and/or http server in plain java(no tomcat or whatever) this is probably what you're looking for.

Options to add your own socket server are included(SocketServer is abstract).
It is also very(VERY) simple to setup a tcp server with command handling etc. within 2 minutes.
Same goes for an HttpServer, command handling etc. is included.

Please refer to the wiki pages (Which will be built soon) for help.
JavaDoc will also be published soon.

Everything is and will stay Open Source and published under the MIT licence.
Please read the license for specifics.
Long story short, use it for whatever you want(personal/commercial is both ok).

Help, suggestions and bug reports are appreciated, feel free to open up an issue.
